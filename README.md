# Disney over the years: An analysis of Walt Disney's revenue
Hi! This was my first programming project using Python for UBC's extended learning course, Programming in Python for Data Science. 

# Description
In this project, I investigated how the proportion of revenue across different divisions of the Walt Disney company changed over the years. 

# Files Included
* _disney_revenue_1991-2016.csv_ contains data on the Walt Disney company's revenue from 1991 to 2016. Revenue is categorized by each division of the company.
* _disney_revenue_JUP.ipynb_ is a Jupyter Notebook that details the data cleaning, analysis, and discussion completed for this project.
* _prop_calc.py_ is a python script for a function which updates a list of columns in a dataframe with their proportios out of a specified column representing their totals.
* _test_prop_calc.py_ is a python script that creates helper data to test the prop_calc function
